Identifier

An identifier is a sequence of characters in the code that identifies a variable, function, or property. In most languages, identifiers are case-sensitive and not quoted.

In JavaScript, identifiers can contain Unicode letters, $, _, and digits (0-9), but may not start with a digit. An identifier differs from a string in that a string is data, while an identifier is part of the code. In JavaScript, there is no way to convert identifiers to strings, but sometimes it is possible to parse strings into identifiers.




JavaScript Declarations :



JavaScript has three kinds of variable declarations.

var

    Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
let

    Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
const

    Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.



A JavaScript identifier usually starts with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0 â€“ 9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters A through Z (uppercase) as well as a through z (lowercase).
